A project for my 2nd semester IPI class, with the theme "shooting game".

## How to play

(only tested on Linux) Execute file Main.py via the terminal.

### Controls

In the menu :
- Z and S to move the cursor
- A to select

In game :
- Q and D to move left and right
- Z to jump
- S to shoot
- A to give up

## Known bugs

- (uncommon) Game crashes seemingly at random
- Player character clips into the ground after a jump
